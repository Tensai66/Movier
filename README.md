Movier Web App README
-------------->

This project will be created using React.js as a front-end in conjunction with Redux with the tMDB API for movie information and Node.js as the back-end to create a RESTful API that interacts with MongoDB to store user account information and user favorites.

To better learn how to use CSS and to eventually expand into SaSS, flex styling was used instead of Bootstrap.

This web app is also mobile-friendly for all features including:

- User Signup/Login/Profile
- Viewing Movie Info
- Adding Movie Info
